# Project Constitution

## Purpose of the Constitution
This document serves as the primary governance framework for the system. it defines the core values, methodologies, and standards that guide the evolution of the application. The objective is to maintain a high-quality, scalable, and maintainable system through rigorous adherence to predefined principles.

## Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Principles
Spec-Driven Development is the foundational methodology of this project. It dictates that all functional changes must originate from a formal specification. The specification is the single source of truth. Developers (both human and AI) are expected to align every implementation detail with the documented requirements.

## Phase-Based Evolution Philosophy
Growth is achieved through structured phases. Each phase represents a measurable leap in system maturity. By breaking the roadmap into discrete phases, we ensure that the foundation is stable before adding complex layers. This prevents technical debt and ensures that each feature is built on a solid architectural base.

## AI-First Development Mindset
This system is designed to be built and maintained by AI-native processes. The documentation is structured to provide maximum clarity for automated reasoning. The goal is to minimize manual intervention by providing comprehensive, unambiguous instructions through specifications.

## No-Manual-Coding Principle
Conceptually, the system strives for a state where logic is derived directly from intent. Manual code adjustments are viewed as temporary measures; the ultimate aim is a system where the specification itself acts as the primary configuration for the generated output.

## Governance and Quality Rules
All contributions must undergo a validation process against this constitution. Quality is not a post-process activity but an inherent part of the development cycle. Adherence to accessibility standards, performance benchmarks, and design consistency is mandatory.

## Learning and Evaluation Alignment
The system is built to facilitate learning. Every architectural decision is documented to provide insight into why specific paths were chosen. Evaluation is continuous, ensuring that the final product meets the original vision while adapting to new insights gained during the development process.
