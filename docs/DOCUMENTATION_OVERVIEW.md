# Documentation Overview

## What These Documents Are
This folder contains the auxiliary documentation for the project, created to align with high-level system design standards and hackathon planning requirements. It includes the Constitution, System Planning, and Phase-Wise Specifications.

## Why They Exist
These documents demonstrate a Spec-Driven Development (SDD) approach. They provide a blueprint for how a system should be conceived, planned, and evolved through structured logic and AI-friendly requirements. This methodology ensures that the software is not just "written" but "engineered" from a solid foundation of intent.

## Hackathon Requirements
These documents satisfy the need for comprehensive project documentation including:
A clear vision and set of principles (Constitution).
Architectural planning and justification (Planning).
A structured, phased approach to feature development (Specs).

## Application Integrity Statement
These files are for documentation and planning purposes only. They remain independent of the application logic. The Todo app's code does not import or rely on these files, ensuring that the documentation remains a standalone "truth" for the system's design philosophy.
