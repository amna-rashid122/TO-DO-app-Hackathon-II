# System Planning Document

## Project Overview
The project is a high-performance task management ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between aesthetic design and functional complexity. It aims to provide a premium user experience while maintaining a simple, localized data structure.

## Why Spec-Driven Development Was Chosen
Spec-Driven Development (SDD) was selected to ensure absolute alignment between vision and execution. In a fast-paced environment, SDD provides a roadmap that prevents feature creep and ensures that high-level goals are not lost in technical details. It allows for rapid prototyping while keeping the documentation in sync with the actual system behavior.

## High-Level System Architecture
The system follows a modular frontend architecture. It is designed to be entirely self-contained, relying on local storage for persistence to eliminate backend latency. The architecture prioritizes state management efficiency and component reusability. A custom visual language based on depth and glassmorphism provides the user interface layer.

## Intelligence and Automation Planning
Automation is planned at the requirement level. By utilizing clear Markdown specifications, the system allows AI tools to interpret and implement features with high precision. Intelligence is integrated into the UI through smart sorting algorithms and priority-based rendering, which are planned to evolve into predictive task organization.

## Constraints and Assumptions
The system assumes a modern browser environment with support for local storage. A primary constraint is the absence of a server-side database, which necessitates robust client-side data handling. The planning assumes that users value a premium visual experience alongside core productivity features.

## Learning Outcomes
The primary learning objective is to master the transition from high-level spec to functional product. This project serves as a testbed for AI-native development workflows, demonstrating how structured planning can lead to superior UI/UX outcomes without traditional manual overhead.
